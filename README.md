# RAG LangChain Pipeline Project

Welcome to the **RAG Pipeline project**! This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using LangChain and Hugging Face's Qwen language model. The goal of this project is to combine state-of-the-art retrieval-based techniques with language generation models to enhance the capability of answering questions with contextually relevant information.

## Project Overview

The **RAG Pipeline** integrates retrieval-based models with **generation-based models** to generate more accurate and context-aware responses. It retrieves relevant information from a document store (using FAISS for efficient retrieval) and then uses the Qwen language model to generate answers based on the retrieved documents.
In this project you will find a fully functional pipeline using:
- **LangChain**: For easy integration of different components like retrievers and language models.
- **FAISS**: For efficient vector search and document retrieval.
- **HuggingFace's Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model**: A powerful generative language model used for answering questions based on the retrieved context.

## How It Works
 - **Text Chunking**: irst, the input text (such as documents or articles) is chunked into smaller pieces. This helps in efficiently processing large documents.
 - **Embeddings & FAISS**: The chunks are converted into embeddings using a pre-trained embedding model (from Hugging Face's sentence transformers). These embeddings are then indexed using FAISS for fast retrieval of similar documents.
 - **Retriever**: The RAG pipeline uses a retriever that queries the FAISS index to find the most relevant chunks based on a user query.
 - **Question Answering**: Once the relevant text chunks are retrieved, the Qwen language model generates the final answer by processing both the query and the retrieved context.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all core code for the RAG pipeline.
  - `rag_pipeline.py`: Builds and executes the RAG pipeline, combining retrieval with a Hugging Face LLM.
  - `utils.py`: Contains helper functions for text chunking and processing.
  - `main.py`: Entry point to run the RAG pipeline with your own query.
- `data/`: Contains all the input documents and responses of the model
  - Contains the `responses.pdf` file with sample responses generated by the RAG pipeline.
  - Contains the `document.pdf` file which is used as a input pdf for the queries asked.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- An NVIDIA GPU (optional, but recommended for faster processing)
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt` (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishi2674/RAG-Langchain-Pipeline.git
   cd RAG-Langchain-Pipeline
   
2. **Installing Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishi2674/RAG-Langchain-Pipeline.git
   cd RAG-Langchain-Pipeline
   
3. **Prepare Text Data**: Organize your text data for retrieval by storing chunks of text in the pipeline. The data can be processed and split into chunks using the `chunk_text` function in `utils.py`.
4. **Run the RAG Pipeline**: Execute the pipeline with:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
  You can modify `main.py` to enter specific queries to retrieve relevant text and generate responses.

## Sample Responses
A sample of the RAG pipeline's output can be found in the `data` directory under `responses.pdf`. This file includes example queries and the model’s responses, showcasing the effectiveness of the RAG approach.

## Notes on Usage
- Ensure that the necessary model files are downloaded and stored in the correct paths.
- Configure the FAISS index and Hugging Face model as per your requirements in `rag_pipeline.py`.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: For creating and managing the RAG pipeline.
- **HuggingFace**: Utilized for both embeddings and text generation.
- **FAISS**: High-performance similarity search library for vector-based retrieval.

## Acknowledgments
This project leverages the LangChain framework and models from HuggingFace for powerful and customizable retrieval-augmented generation. Special thanks to the open-source contributors of both libraries for making such tools available.
